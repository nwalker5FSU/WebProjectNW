                             <li>Local property managers have websites that are very "cookie-cutter" and lack some key elements.
                                 They succeed at having a professional website that looks great and functions properly, but there
                                 was not enough effort put into the flow of the website.</li>

                             <li>I think my background in computer science and web design will be useful to create a webstie that
                                 looks nicer than the competitors as well as flows better.</li>
